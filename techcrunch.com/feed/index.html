										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hyundai announced this week at the LA Auto Show a new way for its customers to charge at home as part of the company&#8217;s efforts to woo a new group of EV buyers.</p>
<p>Hyundai Home, the automaker calls it, incorporates solar panels, energy storage and EV charging for Hyundai owners. Hyundai announced a partnership with Electrum, a solar panel, home battery and heat pump installer, which will help customers in 16 states find the right power installers and systems for their EV charging needs. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">With the new partnership, consumers in Arizona, California, Colorado. Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Washington can now work with Electrum advisors to find the best and most affordable power solutions for them.</span></p>
<p>Prior to this week&#8217;s announcement, dealers were helping customers get in touch with local installers and power suppliers in order to get charging and storage set up for their new Hyundai EVs like the Ioniq 5, according to Ian Tupper, the senior group manager of strategic environmental partnerships at Hyundai.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Hyundai Home, we&#8217;re really trying to democratize, not only EV charging and being able to adopt an electric vehicle, but the entire ecosystem around it. We want to make it easy for customers to go solar to get energy storage and to eventually use all those systems together to reduce their energy bill,&#8221; Tupper told TechCrunch during an interview at the LA Auto Show.</p>
<h2>Making EV charging more accessible</h2>
<p>As the U.S. increasingly makes a push to reduce carbon emissions, especially those from tailpipes (aka fossil-fueled powered vehicles), states like California have banned the sale of new gasoline vehicles by 2035. That means that an increasing number of Americans are going to be looking at EVs, PHEVs and hybrids for their next new car purchase. Yet, rentals make up roughly one-third of American housing, according to the U.S. Census and most of that housing stock is older, which means that in order to get access to at-home charging, landlords will have to be willing to invest to upgrade panels and provide charging access in multifamily garages.</p>
<p>The average cost to upgrade a single family home&#8217;s electrical panel to handle charging a vehicle at home, can run <a href="https://www.thisoldhouse.com/electrical/reviews/cost-to-upgrade-electrical-panel">between $1,300 and $3,000</a>, or more. Add that into the high price of battery-electric, hybrid and plug-in electric vehicles and many people wont be able to afford or access home charging, especially those who live in multifamily buildings without access to home charging. That&#8217;s something that Tupper says Hyundai is taking into consideration, but he wasn&#8217;t able to share any concrete details around future plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we want to achieve mass adoption, we need to solve that problem for renters and so we&#8217;re attacking it in a couple of different ways. First through our partnership with Electrify America. We&#8217;re working with them to incentivize to construction of as much charging infrastructure as possible and we&#8217;re trying to give it to customers for free,&#8221; Tupper told TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;re taking a strategic partnership approach and trying to identify the players right to offer, really a smattering of solutions. If there&#8217;s a city where, you know, we can help support the production or the development of charging hub, great. But if there&#8217;s a way for us to even incentivize low-power AC Charging. We&#8217;re going to take a look at that as well.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tupper says that Hyundai is working with its partners like Electrum to bring more charging and power storage options to more customers in other states outside of the 16 that Electrum currently services, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just starting out,&#8221; Tupper said, &#8220;Our guiding principles are that customers not only get the right products, but they also get the right products at the right price. Electrum helps us help the customer find the right solution on the marketplace, that way we&#8217;re actually able to deliver, usually a substantially better deal than something that they would normally just get by going to a local provider.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hey, hey, Mary Ann here, feeling all sorry for myself because I have COVID for the first time when I should be grateful that it took so long for me to get it, right? Thankfully you can&#8217;t catch my germs through a computer or phone screen. I&#8217;ll be okay but as a result&#8230;you&#8217;re stuck with another slightly abbreviated version of this newsletter! Huge credit to, and gratitude for, TechCrunch&#8217;s Kyle Wiggers, who once again saved the day by writing up all the blurbs (and there were many to cover) here. Kyle, you&#8217;re the best.</p>
<p>Since Thanksgiving is less than a week away, I&#8217;ll take this opportunity to say how truly thankful I am to be given the trust and confidence to draft this newsletter and for you all to take the time to read and share it. I do not take this lightly because without your support, I would not be doing this. I know there are a ton of fintech-focused newsletters out there, so it really does mean the world. Okay, now that I&#8217;m done with the cringe part of this newsletter (to quote my children), let&#8217;s go straight to the news.</p>
<h2>Weekly News</h2>

<p><strong>Plaid</strong> announced it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/17/fintech-plaid-names-former-meta-exec-as-its-new-payments-head/">hired John Anderson</a>, a former Meta exec, to serve as its first head of payments. The move comes as the fintech startup leans into payments, both in terms of facilitating them itself and aiming to help others do so better and faster. Our first thought is that it was taking another swing at Stripe, but interestingly the two remain partners &#8212; for now. Plaid also announced that its <a href="https://plaid.com/products/signal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Signal offering</a> is out of beta with early users such as Robinhood, Webull and Uphold. It claims that by using Signal, companies can &#8220;unlock instant ACH.&#8221;</p>
<p>In contrast to crypto, some segments of the lending market appear to be robust &#8212; at least presently. <strong>Nu Holdings</strong>, the Warren Buffett–backed Brazilian banking firm that offers credit cards and personal loans and that is more commonly known as Nubank, <a href="https://building.nubank.com.br/nu-holdings-results-for-q3-2022-growing-strong-and-profitable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted a nearly threefold jump</a> in Q3 revenue on Monday. While publicly traded Nu has seen its U.S. shares lose over half their value this year, its customer base has grown to over 70 million following a dramatically expanded footprint in Mexico. Nu&#8217;s total revenue in Q3 reached $1.3 billion, up 171%, while profit climbed to $427 million, up 90%.</p>
<p>Five years ago, Revolut, the British fintech company with an expanding portfolio of banking services, made the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/23/revolut-now-has-a-million-customers-for-its-banking-alternative/"> news</a> when it reached over a million customers across Europe. That seems quaint now; this week, <strong>Revolut</strong><a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/41329/revolut-goes-for-global-growth-after-hitting-25-million-customer-milestone" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> hit</a> 25 million customers globally as the firm prepares to expand into new markets, including India, Mexico, Brazil and New Zealand. Revolut was last valued at $33 billion, but as of last year at least, the company wasn&#8217;t yet profitable; Revolut reported a £167 million (~$197.94 million) net loss in 2021, its largest ever.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Are valuations retreating and the backlog of IPOs growing in fintech, as chatter across the Twitter-verse implies? <strong>Silicon Valley Bank</strong> says yes on both counts in its State of the Markets <a href="https://www.svb.com/trends-insights/reports/state-of-the-markets-report-c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> out this week. According to the firm, the steepest declines in valuation have occurred for late-stage fintech companies; &#8220;enterprise value&#8221; to &#8220;next 12 months&#8221; revenue multiples for public fintechs have dipped 55% since the market peaked in early January. Meanwhile, since the end of 2021, the number of U.S. fintech unicorns has grown by 38% to 159 — standing at a staggering $656 billion in aggregate valuation, highlighting the massive backlog looking to exit.</p>
<p>According to a<a href="https://eship.unc.edu/studentspotlight/qa-with-aaron-houghton/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20study%20by%20the%20National%20Institute%20of%20Mental%20Health%2C%2072%25%20of%20entrepreneurs%20are%20directly%20or%20indirectly%20affected%20by%20mental%20health%20issues%2C%20compared%20to%20just%2048%25%20of%20non%2Dentrep" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> study</a> by the National Institute of Mental Health, 72% of startup founders are affected by mental health issues. Stepping out of its lane somewhat, fintech giant <strong>Brex</strong> launched a program, Catharsis, which is designed to provide resources dedicated to mental health. Brex says it&#8217;ll facilitate access to therapists via a partnership with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/spring-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spring Health</a> as well as extend a discount on the sleep-tracking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/oura/">Oura Ring</a>. Seems like a worthwhile cause, but part of us wonders whether the effort is intended to distract from Brex&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/17/brex-which-started-out-serving-startups-now-says-it-is-less-suited-to-meet-the-needs-of-smaller-customers/">poorly received pivot</a> away from supporting small businesses.</p>
<p>Charge cards are big business.<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/06/10/2460340/28124/en/Global-Charge-Card-Market-Trends-and-Growth-Forecasts-Compound-Annual-Growth-of-1-with-Market-Set-to-Reach-2-04-Billion-in-2026.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> According</a> to Research and Markets, the segment could be worth over $2 billion by 2026, growing from $1.96 billion this year. That&#8217;s probably why banking-as-a-service startup <strong>Unit</strong> is investing in it &#8212; the company on Tuesday<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/15/units-banking-as-a-service-platform-is-getting-into-the-charge-card-game/"> launched</a> a service that&#8217;ll allow customers to build custom charge cards for their own end users. Unit handles nearly all aspects of the back end, including card printing, compliance and transaction tracking. In this way, it&#8217;s a different approach than corporate card issuers Brex and Ramp, Unit CEO Itai Damti argues, which are strictly business-to-business &#8212; Unit sees its offering as more &#8220;business-to-business-to-consumer.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you’re itching for reading material on the<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2022/11/17/jpmorgan-forecasts-mild-recession-in-2023--heres-what-major-financial-institutions-predicted-this-week/#:~:text=A%20report%20by%20Morgan%20Stanley,to%20see%20a%20major%20downturn." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> forecasted</a> economic woes in the tech sector, Ukraine-based fintech investor <strong>Vadym Synegin</strong> wrote an excellent piece for TC+ on what founders can do to help their companies prosper in times of crises. Among other steps, he suggests that founders double down on developing and proving the quality of their products, manage risk and look for ways to shore up their company&#8217;s ranks with high-performing talent.</p>
<p>Just over a year ago, <strong>Wise</strong> &#8212; the company formerly known as TransferWise &#8212; went<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/11/fueled-by-the-remote-work-revolution-deel-more-than-doubles-valuation-to-12b-with-new-raise/"> public</a> on the London market. Now, in search of new growth avenues, Wise is<a href="https://newsroom.wise.com/en-NAM/220201-wise-platform-and-deel-make-it-even-faster-to-get-paid-with-new-feature" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> inking</a> an expanded partnership with up-and-coming remote hiring startup <strong>Deel</strong> to enable companies to pay employees faster (ostensibly). Wise and Deel&#8217;s new feature lets customers send funds via Deel using just an email address, opening up new currencies in Deel&#8217;s existing payments infrastructure. To take advantage, Deel customers simply need to open an account with Wise and connect it to the Deel platform.</p>
<p>In another<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/14/preparing-for-fintechs-second-decade-4-moves-your-firm-must-make-now/"> post</a> for TC+, fintech consultant <strong>Greg Easterbrook</strong> lays out four moves he believes fintech firms must make to set themselves up for success over the coming months. He urges startup founders to ensure their tech stacks support fintech&#8217;s cutting edge, and he warns of competition from traditional financial firms offering more of a &#8220;super app&#8221; experience with strong member benefits and perks. The fintechs that outperform the market will either specialize in specific services or embrace a strategy to build compelling new products and perks, Easterbrook says.</p>
<p>Despite being the world&#8217;s largest prepaid debit card company by market cap, <strong>Green Dot</strong> usually flies under the radar. But the firm has faced challenges in recent months, disclosing that it&#8217;s in a dispute with Uber &#8212; one of its contract customers &#8212; and that &#8220;several&#8221; of its banking-as-a-service clients declined to renew their contracts this summer. In a<a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/green-dot-focuses-on-tech-modernization-amid-leadership-shakeup/636391/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> shake-up</a> aimed at righting the ship, Green Dot named a new CFO, COO and chief revenue officer this week and said it was focusing on tech modernization, including a move to a cloud-based core banking platform and card management system.</p>
<p>Fintech startup <strong>Bump</strong> and <strong>Mastercard</strong> are<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/11/16/2557470/0/en/Bump-Teams-Up-with-Mastercard-and-Highnote-to-Launch-the-Bump-Creator-Card-Helping-Creators-Grow-Their-Businesses.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> collaborating</a> on a new card aimed at musicians and content creators (think TikTok influencers). How does one build a card for creators, you might ask? Well, in Bump&#8217;s case, they do away with monthly fees and credit checks, factoring in things like a customer&#8217;s web3 assets (e.g., cryptocurrencies, NFTs) when determining credit limits. There&#8217;s plenty of other cards out there that don&#8217;t require a credit check, and at least one startup,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/24/spectral-raises-23m-to-help-create-web3-credit-scores/"> Spectral</a>, is attempting to create a system of web3 &#8220;credit scores.&#8221; But Bump&#8217;s offering is intriguing nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>StellarFi</strong>, a credit-building service that makes bill payments on your behalf and reports them to the major credit bureaus, is on the upswing. The company<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stellarfi-surpasses-1m-arr-five-months-after-launch-emerges-as-critical-option-for-americans-facing-financial-challenges-301679239.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> announced</a> this week that it has surpassed $1 million in annual recurring revenue just five months after launch and that its customer base has grown 83% during the past month. The current economic climate likely has something to do with StellarFi&#8217;s success &#8212; U.S. inflation remains above 7% and short-term borrowing rates are at their highest level since January 2008.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Former President Donald Trump&#8217;s Twitter account has been reinstated following a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">permanent ban</a> in January 2021.</p>
<p>On Friday, new Twitter owner Elon Musk posted a poll asking if Trump should be allowed back on the platform. Just over 15 million people voted, with 51.8% voting in favor of reinstating Trump on Twitter.</p>
<p>As of July 2022, when Twitter filed its last <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2022/q2/Final_Q2'22_Earnings_Release.pdf">quarterly earnings report</a> before going private, the platform has about 237.8 million monetizable daily active users. Yet when Musk&#8217;s impromptu poll ended on Saturday with a small fraction of the user base taking part, Trump&#8217;s account was <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">unbanned</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people have spoken. Trump will be reinstated. Vox Populi, Vox Dei,&#8221; Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1594131768298315777">tweeted</a>, quoting a Latin phrase that translates to &#8220;the voice of people, the voice of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the former president announced this week that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/11/15/us/election-news-results?smid=url-share#trump-presidential-run">he will run</a> for the nation&#8217;s highest office once again in 2024.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reinstate former President Trump</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1593767953706921985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2022</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Trump&#8217;s controversial ban took place days after the January 6 riots on the U.S. Capitol, in which insurrectionists violently attempted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>&#8220;After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them &#8212; specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter &#8212; we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,&#8221; Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension">wrote</a> in a January 2021 blog post.</p>
<p>Since taking over Twitter mere weeks ago, Elon Musk has already <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1593673844996288512">reversed suspensions</a> on two high-profile accounts that were deplatformed for maliciously misgendering trans people: conservative satire publication The Babylon Bee and Jordan Peterson. He also reversed the ban on Kathy Griffin, a comedian who had impersonated Musk on Twitter.</p>
<p>When Musk initially announced his bid to take over Twitter, he had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/10/elon-musk-trump-perma-ban/">voiced his support</a> for overturning the permanent ban on the former president. Now that he owns the company, Musk is using his own Twitter account to announce updates to platform policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;New Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach,&#8221; Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1593673339826212864">tweeted</a> yesterday before starting his poll about Trump&#8217;s account. &#8220;Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted &amp; demonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Already in his tenure, Musk has gone <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/11/elon-musk-twitter-official-verification-chaos/">back and forth</a> on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/09/fake-twitter-blue-check-lebron-musk/">implementation</a> of new features, so it&#8217;s challenging to take his word as the end-all-be-all with regard to how Twitter will handle content moderation. Yet Musk is certainly setting a precedent for his leadership at Twitter by allowing the results of a spontaneous day-long poll to dictate complex content moderation decisions.</p>
<p>Regardless, it is unclear whether the former president will actually return to Twitter. After he was deplatformed from mainstream social media networks like Twitter, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/youtube-puts-a-temporary-freeze-on-uploads-to-trumps-channel/">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/facebook-will-reconsider-trumps-ban-in-two-years/">Facebook</a>, Trump created his own social platform called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/16/trump-twitter-return-truth-social/#!">Truth Social</a>. And one of Truth Social&#8217;s main selling points is that Trump actively uses it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vote now with positivity, but don&#8217;t worry, we aren&#8217;t going anywhere. Truth Social is special!&#8221; the former president posted on Truth Social this evening, referencing Musk&#8217;s Twitter poll.</p>
<p>Truth Social debuted on iOS in February with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/21/trumps-truth-social-app-launch-store-errors/">glitchy launch</a>, using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/mastodon-issues-30-day-ultimatum-to-trumps-social-network-over-misuse-of-its-code/">uncredited</a> source code from Mastodon.

Internally, Truth Social&#8217;s parent company, the Trump Media and Technology Group, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/10/business/trump-truth-social-spac.html">struggling to complete</a> a proposed merger to go public via SPAC.</p>
<p>As of September, data from SensorTower shows that about 3.7 million users had downloaded the Truth Social app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rapid grocery deliver startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/getir/">Getir</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/gopuff/">Gopuff</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/gorillas/">Gorillas</a>, once heralded as the next big thing in on-demand ordering, are running up against logistical challenges that might very well be insurmountable. Even faced with competition and sky-high operating costs, though, they&#8217;re taking what steps they can to stick around. Case in point, Gopuff today launched features aimed at eliminating some of the platform&#8217;s biggest pain points, like the inability to schedule orders ahead or pick up orders from nearby stockrooms.</p>
<p>Starting today, Gopuff customers can place an order when the Gopuff marketplace closes &#8212; the exact hours depend on the market &#8212; to have Gopuff deliver the order as soon as it reopens. (Needless to say, this doesn&#8217;t apply to locations where Gopuff delivers 24/7.) Alternatively, customers can schedule an order in advance for a specific date and time, similar to most major food delivery apps, or arrange for an order to be picked up where Gopuff offers retail and in-store shopping.</p>
<p>The in-store shopping experience remains rather limited. According to Gopuff, only in BevMo! outlets &#8212; recall that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/gopuff-acquires-bevmo/">Gopuff acquired BevMo!</a>, the alcohol retailer, for $350 million in 2020 &#8212; and locations in New York City is shopping in-store an option. Strictly pickup of online orders will be offered at &#8220;many&#8221; locations, however, Gopuff says (it&#8217;s unclear just how many), with the hours mirroring that of in-app ordering.</p>
<p>Gopuff is also introducing gifting, which will allow customers to add gifts to their cart for recipients both on and off the platform. Once they enter the recipient&#8217;s address, name and phone number and a gift message, both the gift recipient and the sender will receive a text message confirming a gift order is being prepared. The recipient will also receive SMS alerts when the order is close by, delivered or canceled.</p>
<p>Gopuff didn&#8217;t initially respond to TechCrunch&#8217;s question about whether gift recipients&#8217; information are retained for marketing or other purposes. Gopuff, like many app-based products and services, <a href="https://legal.gopuff.com/policies/en/?name=gopuff-privacy-notice#4-how-we-use-your-personal-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collects</a> a broad swath of personal information that it reserves the right to use for ad targeting and promoting its subscription services, as well as sharing with third parties including business partners and &#8220;affiliates and subsidiaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a follow-up email, a Gopuff spokesperson clarified that gift recipient info isn&#8217;t retained for use in these ways.</p>
<p>The new features are only available via the latest Gopuff app (version 8.1.0), the company notes, which began rolling out nationwide this morning.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gopuff has had a rough go of it lately, no pun intended. Originally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/gopuff-the-instant-grocery-startup-is-raising-up-to-1-5b-at-up-to-a-40b-valuation-ahead-of-going-public-as-soon-as-mid-2022/">intending</a> to IPO as soon as mid-2022 after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/18/gopuff-the-instant-delivery-upstart-taps-ex-disney-head-bob-iger-as-its-newest-investor-and-advisor/">tapping</a> ex-Disney CEO Bob Iger as an advisor and investor, Gopuff this summer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/30/gopuff-spain-exit/">pulled out</a> of Spain, one of its markets, to slash costs, and laid off 10% of its global workforce. Further <a href="https://technical.ly/startups/gopuff-layoffs-250-customer-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cuts</a> hit Gopuff in October &#8212; mainly affecting various customer service departments &#8212; as the startup <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/delivery/2022/report-gopuff-seeking-300m-credit-line-following-stalled-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> looked to secure a credit line as high as $300 million to buffet against inflationary headwinds.</p>

<p><em>(There won&#8217;t be a newsletter next Saturday because I&#8217;ll be off being thankful/eating leftovers/being thankful for leftovers, but we&#8217;ll be back to our regularly scheduled programming the weekend after.)</em></p>
<p>If you read last week&#8217;s edition, you&#8217;ll notice some echoes here: more layoffs, more FTX drama, and more absurdity at Elon&#8217;s Twitter. Let&#8217;s dive in!</p>
<p>—<a href="http://twitter.com/grg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg</a></p>
<h2>most read</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/16/musk-poses-workers-with-a-choice-quit-twitter-or-prepare-to-get-hardcore/"><strong>Mass resignations at Twitter</strong></a>: After laying off thousands of Twitter employees over the past few weeks, Elon presented something of an ultimatum to those remaining: commit to being &#8220;extremely hardcore&#8221; as &#8220;part of the new Twitter&#8221; or leave with three months severance&#8230;and, well, a <em>lot </em>of people took door number 2. It&#8217;s unclear at this point (even to Twitter, it seems) how many declined the ultimatum, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/technology/twitter-elon-musk-ftc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all indications</a> are that it was hundreds/thousands.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/16/sbf-regrets-declaring-ftx-bankrupt-per-his-dms-to-vox/">SBF DMs</a></strong>: For some reason the founder of FTX — the once massive crypto exchange that imploded last week — decided to have an impromptu interview with a Vox reporter by way of DM. Seemingly without any agreement that any of it was off the record, said DMs were, of course, quickly published. His biggest regret in all this? Weirdly, filing for bankruptcy.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/16/bending-spoons-acquires-evernote-marking-the-end-of-an-era/">Evernote gets bought</a></strong>: Evernote was once something of an App Store darling — an early go-to example of design, quality, and company leadership. Then after a series of pricing/privacy/design changes pissed off the user base, it just sort of&#8230;faded away. This week the company was acquired by Italian app developer Bending Spoons, in what Kyle Wiggers calls &#8220;the end of an era.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/16/amazon-begins-layoffs-as-economic-woes-mount/">Amazon layoffs</a></strong>: Rumors suggested layoffs were on the way at Amazon, with some estimates suggesting upward of 10,000 would be let go. This week the layoffs began, with CEO Andy Jassy writing in a memo that the layoffs will continue into next year.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/17/screaming-crying-ticketmaster-taylor-swift/">Ticketmaster face-plants</a></strong>: Tickets for Taylor Swift’s first tour in years went on presale this week, and Ticketmaster, the website that no one on earth is happy to use, couldn’t keep up with the Swifties. Things went so awry with the gated presale that the scheduled public sale was outright canceled. You know your site outage is bad when it <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1592587226801934336" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relights the political fire</a> to break up your company’s overwhelming dominance.</p>
<h2>audio roundup</h2>
<p>Podcasts! We&#8217;ve got them! People seem to like them! Or a lot of people are just downloading/subscribing for the sake of inflating our collective ego. That&#8217;s okay too. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s up in TC podcasts lately:</p>
<ul>
<li>Live from our TechCrunch Sessions: Crypto event during one of crypto&#8217;s wildest weeks in ages, the <a href="https://pod.link/1616008890" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chain Reaction crew</a> &#8220;tore up the script&#8221; and talked all about Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s &#8220;surreal, absurd&#8221; DM conversation with Vox.</li>
<li>What does a corporate comms team do? The <a href="https://pod.link/1215439780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity team</a> sat down with a pair of deeply experienced comms people to learn how all that behind-the-scenes machinery works.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/12/nearly-80-of-venture-funds-raised-in-just-two-states-as-us-lps-retreat-to-the-coasts/"><strong>Two states received 80% of venture funds raised</strong></a>: &#8220;Through the third quarter of 2022, U.S. venture firms raised $150.9 billion across 593 funds,&#8221; writes Rebecca Szkutak. Where did it all go? Rebecca breaks down the stats.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/17/sample-series-a-pitch-deck-sateliot/"><strong>A look at Sateliot&#8217;s Series A deck</strong></a>: 90% of the planet has no cell connectivity. What if you need an IoT device to phone home from, say, the middle of the ocean? That&#8217;s the idea behind Sateliot, which raised an $11.4 million Series A earlier this year. The company shared the pitch deck it used to raise with our resident pitch expert Haje Jan Kamps, who explored &#8220;the good and the bad of this high-flying space deck.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a nuanced take on this week’s startup news and trends by Senior Reporter and Equity co-host </em><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Natasha Mascarenhas.</em></a><em> To get this in your inbox, subscribe here.</em></p>
<p>Well, that didn’t take long. In late October, I wrote about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/26/the-tide-is-shifting-on-techs-layoff-wave-kind-of/">how the tide is shifting on tech layoffs,</a> highlighting that 70% of layoffs that happened this year were conducted over the summer. In fact, using layoffs.fyi data, I claimed that the fall was shaping up to be far less gruesome in terms of net new events and people impacted.</p>
<p>Then, things got worse. Since I published that post, a number of layoffs have been announced from companies including but not limited to Twitter, Meta, Amazon, Chime, Stripe, Lyft, Salesforce and Cisco. (Update: As I put this newsletter together, my colleague Kirsten Korosec broke the news<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/18/autonomous-delivery-startup-nuro-lays-off-20-of-workforce/"> that Nuro laid off 20% of its workforce</a>). (Update #2: Now I’m hearing that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/carvana-plans-to-lay-off-1-500-employees-cites-economic-concerns-11668793114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carvana is reportedly going to lay off 1,500 workers</a>).</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago, 2022 workforce reductions impacted at least 92,558 known people, per layoffs.fyi. That same data source now says that the number has grown to 134,739 known people, or a 46% increase.</p>
<p>Put differently, I said the summer was bad. But now, nearly as many people who were laid off in the summer months of June, July and August, were laid off in November (and the month isn’t even over).</p>
<p>Talk about a rough start to November. According to executives and other industry sources, founders may squeeze more layoffs into the next few days ahead of Thanksgiving and the holiday season. All seem to agree that the worst of the worst is ahead of us — and the true extent of layoffs may only materialize in Q1 2023.</p>
<p>I wasn’t entirely wrong in my poorly aged column. I wrote then that we may just be experiencing a reporting delay and that more layoffs may come as company runways dwindle. There are still loads of companies that raised a ton of money over the boom cycle but aren’t producing nearly enough revenue to justify their historical valuations; the late-stage market is full of them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, to suggest that tech is about to have a big reality check is somewhat surprising to me. Isn’t that what this entire year has been? The only hint that I can latch onto is that some companies have shown us that layoffs have a learning curve — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/05/a-troubling-startup-layoff-trend-has-emerged/">purely because they’ve had to do more than one round in quick succession</a>, basically underlining, highlighting and bolding that they were unable to cut deep enough the first time.</p>
<p>I’ll end by saying that I’m working on an end of the year story about the human impact of layoffs, namely where tech talent goes after they’ve been let go. If you lost your job this year and have an interesting story of what you did next, and how your definition of risk changed, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my Twitter DMs are open.</a> Well, at least as long as the site is.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can find me on <a href="https://natasha.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Substack</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/natashathereporter/?hl=en">Instagram</a> and, well, I’m not going to share my LinkedIn just yet but maybe soon. In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll talk about Elizabeth Holmes, the FTX fall out, eavesdropping and some corners of the internet that made me smile this week.</p>
<h2>Elizabeth Holmes gets sentenced</h2>
<p>Elizabeth Holmes, the infamous founder of Theranos, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/18/elizabeth-holmes-sentenced-to-11-years-in-prison-for-theranos-fraud/">has officially been sentenced to 11.25 years in prison for fraud.</a> The sentencing comes months after Holmes was found guilty on four of 11 counts related to defrauding investors. Theranos COO and Homles&#8217; former boyfriend Ramesh &#8220;Sunny&#8221; Balwani is still awaiting his sentencing after being convicted on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/07/theranos-sunny-balwani-convicted-fraud-elizabeth-holmes/">12 out of 12 counts</a> in his own trial.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important:</strong> The sentencing caps off a long wait to see how Holmes would be held accountable, if at all, for her crimes. Since its launch, the Theranos story has been synonymous with the strengths, and clearly damaging weaknesses, of Silicon Valley hype culture.</p>

<h2>FTX update</h2>
<p>I was out on vacation (and then out sick) while FTX’s meltdown began. Thankfully, my co-workers gifted me <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1593327484744785921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with a ton of content</a> on the actual impact of a crypto exchange collapsing in such a public way. If last week was all about the how, this week was all about the now what. How do investors, startups and people in the crypto world move on? And what lasting impacts does FTX&#8217;s fall out have? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/16/sbf-regrets-declaring-ftx-bankrupt-per-his-dms-to-vox/">(Regrets don’t count).</a></p>
<p><strong>Here’s why it’s important: </strong>As we talked about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/14/cleanup-aisle-ftx/">on the pod</a> this week, the human side of all of this is finally starting to emerge. Take Nestcoin, for example. The African web3 startup declared that it held many of its day-to-day cash used for operating expenses in FTX. As a result, it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/14/african-web3-startup-nestcoin-declares-it-held-its-assests-in-ftx-lays-off-employees/">laying off employees.</a> We also heard about SoftBank following Sequoia’s lead in marking down its investment, but what I really care about is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/14/softbank-ftx-crypto/">how former COO Marcelo Claure addressed the mistake.</a></p>

<h2>What we lose if we lose Twitter</h2>
<p>I’m not going to run you through the latest Twitter headlines because, similar to the introduction of this newsletter, I will probably need to update it every hour to include all the pivots, contradictions and straight up meltdowns that are happening on the platform. What I will do, however, is<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/18/techcrunch-staff-on-what-we-lose-if-we-lose-twitter/"> run through what we lose if we lose Twitter.</a></p>
<p>My earnest co-workers, and I, the most earnest of them all, put together a little post about why we value Twitter and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/18/techcrunch-staff-on-what-we-lose-if-we-lose-twitter/">what disappears if it disappears.</a> Obviously, we’re not saying the platform is dead or going anywhere immediately. But, what if it did?</p>
<h3>Here’s a bit of my excerpt from the TC+ post:</h3>
<blockquote><p>I’m nosy, curious and have a constant fear that I’m missing key comprehension or a hidden angle on a macroeconomic trend. It’s probably why I’m a reporter (and why I’m addicted to Twitter).</p>
<p>Twitter lets me be an eavesdropping, unassuming fly on the wall. That was important when I first re-downloaded it in college and subscribed to get a notification every single time Boston Business Journal tweeted news — and it’s important now as I try to understand what founders think in real time (versus what they want to tell a TechCrunch reporter over Zoom). It helped me get up to speed when I was an intern at the Boston Globe, and it helps me blend in and understand more as a senior reporter at TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Eavesdropping became even more important to me about one week into the pandemic, which happened to be one week into my job at TechCrunch. It became how I found my sources, showing up in the embeds of my stories. It also became how I balanced out my sources, aiming to not just quote the people with the spiciest takes in 180 characters. As an early-career reporter, I feel like Twitter gave me a fighting chance at catching up to all my brilliant colleagues and competitors digesting the news in real time. I mean, I literally saw their thought process every single day.</p>
<p>We all heard that Twitter became our town square during quarantine, but for me, it also became a map.</p></blockquote>

<h2>A good tweets and posts section</h2>
<p>We’re officially at the time of year, and part of the news cycle, when I’m desperately searching for good news to highlight. On <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/18/pick-your-poison-recruitment-or-retention/">Equity this week</a>, we started with some positive growth-focused tech news, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/15/maven-now-valued-at-1-35-billion-is-answering-a-country-wide-demand-more-fertility-benefits/">Maven’s growth and how that helps women’s health</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/14/alibaba-eyes-logistics-growth-in-latam-as-china-commerce-slows/">Alibaba’s expansion despite others&#8217; retreat.</a></p>

<p>This week, Apple’s antitrust battle against Fortnite maker Epic Games <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/14/the-epic-games-apple-antitrust-battle-resumes-today-in-appeals-court/">returned to the courtroom</a> after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/">both</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">sides</a> appealed last year’s ruling in a potentially precedent-setting case over Apple’s alleged anti-competitive behavior. Last year, a U.S. District Court judge had largely favored Apple by ruling the tech giant was not acting as a monopolist with regard to its App Store practices. Epic Games was unhappy with that decision, of course, as it had wanted the court to force Apple to support third-party payments and/or third-party app stores which would have allowed Fortnite to maximize its revenues. Meanwhile, Apple didn’t want to agree to the court’s order that said it would have to permit apps that provide links to alternative payments.</p>
<p>Oral arguments kicked off this week at the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit, in what will be an even higher-stakes trial for determining Apple’s future in the app market and its ability to set its own rules around payments and commissions. This time around, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/19/u-s-department-of-justice-can-join-arguments-in-apple-epic-antitrust-trial-court-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the U.S. Department of Justice and the State of California</a> were granted time to present their own arguments to help explain the proper legal framework for evaluating the antitrust claims against Apple. Though both were technically being neutral, they expressed concerns over how the lower court had too narrowly interpreted parts of U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Act, among other issues. The DoJ, notably, is in the early stages of filing its own antitrust suit against Apple, so how the appeals court rules on this matter could ultimately shape its own ability to effectively prosecute Apple further down the road.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the opening arguments, the lawyer for the DoJ, Nickolai Levin, began by stating the district court erred in saying the Apple Developer Program Licensing Agreement (DPLA) is not concerted action. He explained that Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits contracts that restrain trade, which would include the licensing contract Apple is enforcing here. While the U.S. government wasn&#8217;t prepared to call out Apple&#8217;s contract as either reasonable or unreasonable, it wanted the court to understand that it was not above Section 1 scrutiny.</p>
<p>One of the judges pushed back against this claim, asking if Epic had actually agreed to Apple&#8217;s Developer Program Licensing Agreement with the intention of &#8220;going forward to restrain trade?&#8221; He suggested Epic signed in order to get into a market, actually. The lawyer responded that&#8217;s true, but the terms of the contract are binding, with one party forcing terms on another &#8212; so excluding contracts from Section 1 scrutiny would allow anti-competitive terms to go unpunished.</p>
<p>The court also asked for information on how the government believes the pro-competitive and anti-competitive effects should be weighed against one another to make a judgment, as there was no specific formula to make such a calculation. Levin explained that this boiled down to whether or not the effect of the restraint was to suppress or restrict competition, and cited legal precedent to guide the judges&#8217; understanding.</p>
<p>The U.S. government also believed the lower court misapplied the rule of reason and erred in how it analyzed monopoly power. For example, Apple was able to set prices and keep them there regardless of what its competition did. &#8220;And, as Microsoft explained, that&#8217;s something only a monopolist can do,&#8221; Levin noted.</p>
<p>Of course, Apple&#8217;s legal team came well-prepared too. And, as one judge discovered, Apple&#8217;s lawyer, Mark Perry, who had been a longtime partner at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, was now at a new firm, <a href="https://www.weil.com/articles/weil-adds-partner-mark-perry-as-cohead-of-appeals-and-strategic-counseling-practice-in-washington-dc">Weil</a>. But that didn&#8217;t mean Apple had changed firms &#8212; it just meant it now had two. Or as Perry put it, &#8220;we are one big happy family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perry&#8217;s arguments re-iterated points from the lower court&#8217;s decision, particularly noting that the iPhone was designed to be more secure than the Mac, which is why there&#8217;s no &#8220;sideloading,&#8221; and instead puts apps through human review. And it&#8217;s a requirement that&#8217;s hard-coded into the iOS, the lawyer explained. &#8220;That&#8217;s a technical requirement. Apple then reflected that in the DPLA,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The lawyer also told the court Apple does allow developers to communicate with their users, and there are &#8220;no restrictions on communications.&#8221; Expect, of course, the restrictions he mentioned in his very next breath: that &#8220;Apple does not allow links and buttons because we can&#8217;t review them. We can&#8217;t track them. We can&#8217;t protect users from malware, fraud, porn, hackers, and all those other things. It would be a breach in the wall, an opening that bad actors could exploit. And it&#8217;s not well-thought-out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The case will likely continue for six months or more, so don&#8217;t expect any near-term resolution. And, if neither party is satisfied, it will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court, delaying the decision even longer.</p>

<p>While the Epic-Apple antitrust battle is one of the most significant lawsuits facing Apple right now, the company was also sued this week over another matter.</p>
<p>Another lawsuit is taking on Apple’s data collection practices in the wake of a recent report by independent researchers who found Apple was continuing to track consumers in its mobile apps, even when they had explicitly configured their iPhone privacy settings to turn tracking off. The proposed class action lawsuit, filed by plaintiff Elliot Libman on behalf of himself and other impacted consumers, alleges that Apple’s privacy assurances are in violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act.</p>
<p>As reported last week by <a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-analytics-tracking-even-when-off-app-store-1849757558">Gizmodo</a>, app developers and independent researchers Tommy Mysk and Talal Haj Bakry discovered that Apple was still collecting data about its users across a number of first-party apps even when users had turned off an iPhone Analytics setting that promises to “disable the sharing of Device Analytics altogether.” In their tests, the researchers examined Apple’s own apps including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple TV, Books, and Stocks, and found that disabling this setting as well as other privacy controls didn’t impact Apple’s data collection.</p>
<p>The plaintiff is looking to have the lawsuit certified as a class action and is seeking compensatory, statutory, and punitive damages in addition to other equitable monetary relief.</p>

<h3>Google Play revamps policies around kids&#8217; apps</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1974983" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/teacher-approved.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/teacher-approved.jpg 3342w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/teacher-approved.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/teacher-approved.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/teacher-approved.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/teacher-approved.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/teacher-approved.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/teacher-approved.jpg?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/teacher-approved.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/teacher-approved.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Google Play rolled out a series of changes to its programs and policies around apps designed for children. The company described the update as an expansion of its previously launched “Teacher Approved” program, which includes a review process where teachers and experts vetted apps not just for safety and security elements, but for educational quality and other factors. The newly revamped policies will now impact how apps qualify for this program, which allows apps to gain entry to the Play Store’s “Kids” tab.</p>
<p>Before, Google Play ran two (sometimes overlapping) programs around apps aimed at kids.</p>
<p>App developers were required to participate in <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9893335?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=9877766">Google’s “Designed for Families” program</a> if their app was aimed at children, and could optionally choose to participate in the program if their app targeted both kids and older users. The Designed for Families program included a number of requirements around the app’s content, its functionality, use of ads, data practices, use of warning labels, feature set, underlying technology components, and more. Any apps in this program were also eligible to be rated for the <a href="https://playacademy.exceedlms.com/sl/91535e27">Teacher Approved</a> program, which had stricter guidelines, but entry was not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Now, the additional policy requirements for the Designed for Families program are being rolled into the Play Store’s broader<a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/topic/9877766"> Families Policy</a>. This simplifies the rules for developers building apps for kids and opens up a broader selection of apps to be eligible to be rated for the stricter Teacher Approved program, as well.</p>
<p>The changes aren’t just about serving developers or consumers — they also help Google to meet stricter regulations being considered, drafted, and enacted worldwide around how software is permitted to handle kids’ data — such as the EU’s GDPR and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/uk-now-expects-compliance-with-its-child-privacy-design-code/">the U.K.’s Age Appropriate Design Code</a>. Failure to meet these requirements can result in significant penalties, as Meta recently learned when it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/05/instagram-gdpr-fine-childrens-privacy/">fined roughly $400 million</a> for how it treated children’s data on Instagram, for instance.</p>

The show, launching Nov. 17, will see the hosts reacting to all the World Cup action and will be featured within Apple News in the U.S. and in Apple Podcasts in 103 markets.</li>
<li><strong>Netflix added a new feature that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/15/netflix-new-manage-access-and-devices-feature/">lets subscribers remotely log out of devices</a> </strong>they don&#8217;t recognize or don&#8217;t want to be logged into &#8212; like those where friends, family members or an ex is mooching off your account.

In addition, creators can “remix,” or sample, up to 60 seconds of sounds from other videos, instead of only 15 seconds, as before.</li>
<li><strong>Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/15/spotifys-video-podcast-publishing-tools-expand-to-creators-worldwide/">expanded its video podcasting capabilities</a> to Anchor creators in more than 180 markets worldwide,</strong> after initial launches in select markets, including the U.S. and parts of Europe.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=WPunit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">daily TechCrunch+ column</a> where it gets its name. <em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday?

<p><i>For SaaS companies, net dollar retention is on investor radar more than ever. But it shouldn&#8217;t eclipse gross dollar retention: If you are not tracking both metrics, you could be fighting to add new customers into a leaky bucket. Let&#8217;s explore. — </i><a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Anna</i></a></p>
<h2>Gross dollar retention is &#8220;what protects you during really challenging times&#8221;</h2>
<p>&#8220;Gross retention really speaks to the true stickiness and health of your customer base. It&#8217;s what protects you during really challenging times,&#8221; growth stage VC <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rene-stewart-b32494/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rene Stewart</a> said in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/vista-equity-partners/things-fall-apart-at-10mm-arr-lessons-for-growing-your-saas-company/">sponsored talk</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2021.</p>
<p>And yet, the co-head of <a href="https://www.vistaequitypartners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vista Equity Partners’</a> growth-stage Endeavor Fund added, most VCs she talked to &#8220;probably only care about net retention.&#8221; However, her comments were made in 2021, not 2022. &#8220;Challenging times&#8221; have come upon us since then, making investors and founders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/01/are-investors-really-paying-more-for-profits-than-growth-today/">more mindful of business fundamentals</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> and I have already written about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/08/whats-the-right-ndr-target-for-saas-startups/">importance of net dollar retention</a> when efficient growth is the new holy grail. But how does it differ from gross dollar retention, and how has the latter been faring at most tech companies? Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the Sequoias and the Andreessen Horowitzes of the world continue to swell in size, their influence on venture capital may be heading in the opposite direction as micro funds increase their impact on the industry.</p>
<p>Whether you define micro funds as below $50 million or sub-$25 million, these are truly the funds that power the future of the industry. They help venture hubs take off, bring expertise and specialization to the market, and fill a role in the venture capital ecosystem that larger firms simply can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>They also can be credited with getting a lot of the large unicorn and public companies we know today off the ground, as many of them received some of their first dollars from a micro fund: Robinhood (Elefund), Coinbase (Initialized Capital, which was investing out of a $7 million fund at the time) and Flexport (Anorak Ventures).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written about the rise of micro funds in the U.S. before, but when Sweetwood Ventures reached out to me a month ago about its new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/18/fund-of-funds-sweetwood-ventures-bets-big-on-vcs-smallest-funds/">fund-of-funds strategy</a> to back nano — sub-$15 million — funds in Israel, I was intrigued. I hadn&#8217;t realized that the explosion of micro funds extended beyond the U.S. market, but Sweetwood general partner Amit Kurz told me it was one he had been tracking for a few years now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drive Capital was founded by two former Sequoia Capital Partners looking to start anew in the Midwest. But investors in the Columbus, Oh.-based firm have had a bumpy ride of late, and according to our sources, they aren&#8217;t enjoying it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a dramatic turn for Drive, which announced $1 billion in capital commitments back in June, a healthy amount for a 10-year-old firm whose mission it is to invest nearly everywhere in the U.S. outside of Silicon Valley. In fact, in June, the firm &#8212; cofounded by veteran VCs Mark Kvamme and Chris Olsen &#8212; seemed to be riding high, with a couple of apparent wins in its portfolio and assets under management that had grown to more than $2 billion.</p>
<p>Yet dating back to September &#8212; soon after we interviewed Olsen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/09/vcs-who-cast-a-wider-net-have-double-backed-to-ca-says-this-ex-sequoia-capital-partner/">for a story</a> &#8212; we heard rumblings about a rift, along with separate plans that Kvamme was making. Then came the announcement last month that the team was splitting up.</p>
<p>At first, the story was that Kvamme, who logged more than twice as many years at Sequoia than Olsen, was transitioning to &#8220;partner emeritus&#8221; because, as he told the regional outlet <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2022/10/25/mark-kvamme-drive-capital-partner-emeritus.html?ana=lnk">Columbus Business First</a>, 10 years and four funding cycles was longer than he originally planned to lead Drive Capital. (This came as news to Drive&#8217;s investors.)</p>
<p>This week, the other shoe dropped. <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/inno/stories/news/2022/11/16/mark-kvamme-sovereign-wealth-fund-report.html">Columbus Business First </a>reported that Kvamme, who <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/racing/more-racing/a41534255/mark-kvamme-completes-imsa-mission-petit-le-mans/">races cars</a>, is not zipping off to semi-retirement but instead talking with potential backers about a new fund, the Ohio Fund, which will apparently invest in multiple asset classes, including other funds, public stocks, private companies in Ohio, and infrastructure. The idea is to  &#8220;focus on the future economic vitality of Ohio,&#8221; said an unnamed source to the outlet.</p>
<p>Olsen now says that he&#8217;s surprised by this development. We obtained a letter that Drive sent out to its limited partners tonight that reads:</p>
<p><em>Dear Limited Partner:</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><em>This week an article was published indicating that our Partner Emeritus Mark Kvamme is launching a new investment fund. All of us at Drive were surprised by this news, as we are sure you were too. While we will not send you a note each time a new article about Mark is published, we feel that in the spirit of being a good partner, it&#8217;s appropriate to provide you with a transparent update about this situation and our relationship with Mark.</em></p>
<p><em>After the article was published we spoke with Mark and learned that the prospect of him raising a new fund was leaked to a journalist from an unknown source. According to Mark, he has not yet determined what he is going to do next. Raising a new type of fund is something he is considering, along with other options in public service and personal endeavors.</em></p>
<p><em>We have a formal separation agreement with Mark that prevents him from starting a competitive firm or fund to Drive. Please know that this was a heavily negotiated agreement to ensure that it substantially protects Drive, our Limited Partners&#8217; interests, and everything we are building toward at Drive.</em></p>
<p><em>Again, we do not intend to communicate with you each time a new article is written about Mark, but in this instance, we thought it appropriate to provide clarification. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out [contact information redacted by TechCrunch].</em></p>
<p><em>Sincerely,</em><br />
<em>The Drive Team</em></p>
<p>Olsen declined to comment for this story; we reached out to Kvamme and did not receive a response. But it&#8217;s complicated, to say the least.</p>
<p>According to our sources, part of the split traces to a relationship between Olsen and Yasmine Lacaillade, who was Drive&#8217;s COO for nearly seven years before leaving the firm in April to launch her own investment outfit.</p>
<p>Asked about this, a Drive spokesman downplayed any tensions that may have arisen from a romantic relationship between the two, writing: &#8220;Yes you heard right in that Chris and Yas are in a relationship. That&#8217;s been public knowledge for some time. No comments beyond that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like most venture outfits right now, Drive also finds its portfolio in rougher shape than a year or two ago. One of Drive&#8217;s biggest exits to date has been that of Root Insurance, a now seven-year-old, Columbus, Oh.-based insurance company that specializes in automotive coverage and that staged a traditional IPO in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/root-ipo/car-insurance-startup-root-raises-724-4-million-in-ipo-idUSKBN27D0M3">November 2020</a>. Though the shares performed initially, they&#8217;ve tanked since, currently priced at roughly $7 each after a reverse stock split, down from $486 per share the day the company went public. Olsen stepped off the board in November of last year.</p>
<p>The other big star of Drive&#8217;s portfolio currently &#8212; Olive AI &#8212; is trying to overcome its own challenges. The Columbus-based healthcare automation startup, founded in 2012, has long framed its extensive history of pivots (more than 30 to date) as an inspirational story of trying, then trying again. Olive was rewarded by investors for its willingness to shift gears, too. It has raised a staggering $902 million over the years and said last year that it was valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/03/how-olive-pivoted-27-times-on-its-way-to-a-4-billion-valuation/">$4 billion</a>.</p>
<p>But the outfit was never all that it appeared, according to a series of <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/health-tech-deals/2022/04/05/4-billion-health-tech-startup-olive-overpromises-and-underdelivers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">damning Axios pieces</a>, and by September, the wheels were fast loosening. Most notably, the company&#8217;s chief financial officer and chief product officer were abruptly fired, following out the door numerous C-level executives who also left this fall, including its president, a senior director of operations, its EVP of operations and its SVP of payer product strategy.</p>
<p>Olive AI has since said it will sell a portion of its products and services to Rotera, a company built out of Olive&#8217;s own venture studio.</p>
<p>Limited partners aren&#8217;t happy about these collective developments, but as far as we&#8217;re aware, they have not talked about taking action and it seems unlikely that they will.</p>
<p>First, it&#8217;s exceedingly rare for limited partners to organize against a venture firm to which they&#8217;ve committed capital and only slightly less rare for VCs to extend LPs the courtesy of scaling back their commitments.</p>
<p>They might also expect that Olsen will land on his feet. He does have 16 years of venture investing experience and a staff of roughly 20 at Drive to support him.</p>
<p>Further, there isn&#8217;t much interest in creating headaches for Kvamme, who borders on VC royalty. (His father was a partner at Kleiner Perkins; his first wife is the daughter of another famed VC, former Sequoia Capital partner Pierre Lamond.)</p>
<p>Kvamme is very connected in Ohio, after being lured there originally by his longtime friend John Kasich to take an economic development job. He may also have political aspirations of his own. Indeed, one regional investor recently <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/drive-capital-vc-mark-kvamme-raising-fund-ohio-economic-development-2022-11">told Business Insider</a> that Kvamme may be launching a fund meant to bolster Ohio&#8217;s economy as groundwork for a future campaign.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a playbook that&#8217;s been used effectively before. VC and author JD Vance set up a venture firm in Cincinnati called Narya in late 2019 before announcing his bid for Senate roughly 1.5 years later. In late September, according to Cleveland.com, Kvamme <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/09/the-inside-story-behind-the-28-million-pro-jd-vance-ad-campaign-capitol-letter.html">co-hosted</a> a fundraiser for Vance, who won his race earlier this month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterclowes/details/experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peter Clowes</a> last updated his LinkedIn profile, he listed his role as &#8220;Layoff Survivor&#8221; at Twitter. Yet Clowes, a senior software engineer who joined the company in the spring of 2020, is now gone, too. He quit yesterday, dispassionately explaining <a href="https://twitter.com/peterclowes/status/1593458245712187392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last night</a> on Twitter that he decided to leave not to hobble Twitter or because he hates its new owner, Elon Musk, but simply because he no longer had any incentive to stay.</p>
<p>It now appears that a significant percentage of Clowes&#8217;s colleagues felt the same way. While they weren&#8217;t part of the <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-exec-says-50-employees-lost-jobs-following-acquisition-2022-11-04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50%</a> of Twitter employees who lost their jobs at the end of October in an unprecedented layoff at the social media outfit, as its 3,700 remaining staffers, they were presented with an ultimatum this week by Musk. The <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/16/musk-twitter-email-ultimatum-termination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choice</a> he gave them: commit to a new “extremely hardcore” Twitter, &#8220;working long hours at high intensity,&#8221; or leave the company with three months of severance pay.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobson%27s_choice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hobson&#8217;s choice</a>, Musk was clearly hoping that some percentage of Twitter&#8217;s remaining employees &#8212; who are expensive and who he had no say in hiring &#8212; would opt to leave the company. In fact, Musk reportedly told investors he might slash <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-27/musk-tells-twitter-employees-he-doesn-t-plan-to-cut-75-of-jobs?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75% of staff</a> before taking over the company, so whether he&#8217;s in shock, having cut into the muscle of the company, or he&#8217;s celebrating the success of his enigmatic plan is only something Musk and his inner circle knows.</p>
<p>Certainly, the numbers are stunning to nearly everyone else. Fortune <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/11/18/elon-musk-orders-all-coders-to-show-up-at-twitter-hq-friday-afternoon-after-data-suggests-1000-1200-employees-have-resigned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> earlier today that based on its sources&#8217; internal estimates, at least 1,200 full-time employees just handed in their figurative key cards. Clowes, in a long series of <a href="https://twitter.com/peterclowes/status/1593458225533313025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweets</a> about his own departure, suggests the number could be even higher. Talking about his own &#8220;org,&#8221; he writes that &#8220;85%+&#8221; of his colleagues were laid off in October and that a stunning &#8220;80%&#8221; of those who remained opted out yesterday.</p>
<p>What strikes us, reading Clowes&#8217;s explanation about why he left, isn&#8217;t that so many people walked out with him. It&#8217;s almost more astonishing that 100% of employees didn&#8217;t leave, raising questions about who Musk thought would stick around. If he wanted only those employees with no choice but to kill themselves for now, that seems . . . like a flawed business strategy.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if Musk was hoping to hold onto anyone else, one assumes a carrot would have been offered. Instead, as Clowes wrote yesterday, there were only sticks and lots of them.</p>
<p>Clowes wrote, for example, that he left because he &#8220;no longer knew what I was staying for. Previously I was staying for the people, the vision, and of course the money (lets all be honest). All of those were radically changed or uncertain.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clowes left because had he stayed he &#8220;would have been on-call constantly with little support for an indeterminate amount of time on several additional complex systems I had no experience in.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left because he saw no upside to Musk&#8217;s brash management style, which Clowes suggests he could have tolerated longer if he wasn&#8217;t operating wholly in the dark.</p>
<p>Instead, by his telling, Musk still hasn&#8217;t shared a vision for the platform with employees. &#8220;No five-year plan like at Tesla,&#8221; wrote Clowes. &#8220;Nothing more than what anyone can see on Twitter. It allegedly is coming for those who stayed, but the ask was blind faith and required signing away the severance offer before seeing it. Pure loyalty test.&#8221;</p>
<p>There has been so little communication from the top that rumors and speculation have run rampant, Clowes suggested. Among staffers&#8217; apparent concerns: that not only will Twitter become subscription based but that adult content could become a core component of its offerings. (Underscoring how little insiders have been told, Clowes went on to reference a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-adult-content-sex-twitter-content-moderation/amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wired story</a> about a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/01/elon-musk-twitter-paywalled-video/">Washington Post</a> story about Musk&#8217;s reported discussions with employees about monetizing adult content on Twitter.)</p>
<p>Last, wrote Clowes, there was &#8220;no retention plan&#8221; for those who stayed and &#8220;no clear upside for sticking it through the storm on the horizon. Just &#8216;trust us&#8217; style verbal promises.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, by yesterday, Clowes was living in a fairly bleak work world, one in which his &#8220;friends are gone, the vision is murky, there is a storm coming and no financial upside,&#8221; he wrote. So &#8220;[w]hat would you do?&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Would you sacrifice time with your kids over the holidays for vague assurances and the opportunity to make a rich person richer or would you take the out?&#8221;</p>
<p>You would take the out, which Musk surely expected.</p>
<p>Right? One would think?</p>
<p>We may never know for certain and it probably doesn&#8217;t matter. The bigger question now is whether Musk can build back with whoever is left &#8212; before the <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/11/18/elon-musk-orders-all-coders-to-show-up-at-twitter-hq-friday-afternoon-after-data-suggests-1000-1200-employees-have-resigned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whole thing caves in</a>.</p>

<p>Hey, folks. It&#8217;s Kyle, filling in for the Daily Crunch stalwarts Haje and Christine. I can&#8217;t match my esteemed colleagues&#8217; pith and wit, but &#8212; unlike a certain megalomaniac billionaire who shan&#8217;t be named &#8212; I&#8217;ve promised to avoid any passive-aggressive language about committing to &#8220;hardcore&#8221; work culture. You won&#8217;t have to press a button to pledge your loyalty here, not to worry.</p>
<p>While Twitter under Elon Musk remains the talk of the town (for all the wrong reasons), I&#8217;d like to draw attention for a moment to TechCrunch Sessions: Crypto, our event that took place in Miami this week &#8212; coincidentally as crypto exchange FTX and its tangled web of investments imploded. (We swear we didn&#8217;t plan that, honest.) Happened to be in attendance? Great! If not, we&#8217;ve got you covered with in-depth reviews of all the major sessions. Check them out<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-crypto-2022/"> here</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d much prefer a break from the current news cycle &#8212; and I can&#8217;t blame you, really &#8212; please considering giving this<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/17/is-web3-really-the-new-phase-of-the-internet/"> feature</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ron Miller</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/anitaramaswamy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anita Ramaswamy</a> a read. (You&#8217;ll need a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/techcrunchplus/"> TC+</a> subscription.) While touching on the FTX debacle, it takes a higher-level, detailed look at web3 and tries once and for all to answer the question: &#8220;Is web3 truly innovative or a simple repackaging of existing tech?&#8221; The answer might surprise you.</p>
<p>Now, without further ado, here’s a roundup of this week’s happenings. —<a href="https://twitter.com/kyle_l_wiggers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Kyle</a></p>

In a policy change this week reported by<a href="https://twitter.com/indianidle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ivan</a>, Twitter said that new Twitter accounts will have to wait 90 days before they can buy Blue. It&#8217;s likely aimed at stemming the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/10/elon-musk-twitter-verification-disinformation/"> torrent of impersonations</a> that have been increasingly pervading the platform in recent weeks.</p>

Neither are regulators. Tennessee attorney general Jonathan Skrmetti is among those looking into whether Ticketmaster violated consumers’ rights and antitrust regulations by subjecting customers to technical glitches and hours-long wait times, with many ultimately unable to buy a ticket,<a href="https://twitter.com/catherineshu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Catherine</a> reports.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/17/onlyfans-partners-with-spring-to-add-shopping-features/"><strong>Shop while you&#8230;you know</strong></a>: Merch is coming to OnlyFans. <a href="https://twitter.com/asilbwrites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amanda</a> writes about the platform&#8217;s new partnership with Spring, the e-commerce company formerly known as Teespring, which will allow OnlyFans creators to list physical products directly on their profile pages. OnlyFans isn’t taking a cut of the transactions, but, as Amanda notes, the feature incentivizes creators to integrate their businesses more deeply within the platform.</p>

<p>Is Patreon still the hip place to be for content creators? Fanfix argues that it isn&#8217;t. A Gen Z–focused rival, Fanfix today<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/18/patreon-competitor-fanfix-link-in-bio-platform-superlink-gen-z-creators/"> launched</a> SuperLink, a stand-alone &#8220;link-in-bio&#8221; tool for existing apps like Instagram and Snapchat that displays a creator’s Fanfix page. It might not be novel &#8212; Linktree has long dominated the link-in-bio space &#8212; but, as<a href="https://twitter.com/laurenforristal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Lauren</a> writes, one-year-old Fanfix sees SuperLink as a path to grow its base of more than 9.6 million users, which are reportedly earning millions of dollars on the platform. Certainly there&#8217;s ample opportunity for expansion. A recent Adobe<a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/979560357/files/Adobe-'Future-of-Creativity'-Study_Creators-in-the-Creator-Economy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> survey</a> found that the creator economy &#8212; that is, adults who participate in &#8220;creative activities&#8221; and post and promote their work online &#8212; has grown by over 165 million globally in the last two years.</p>

<p>Getting a startup off the ground is hard work, so asking founders to prepare for an acquisition may sound just as silly as telling them to practice their Academy Award speech in the bathroom mirror.</p>
<p>Still . . . if you&#8217;re ready to launch a startup, you must also be prepared to sell one.</p>
<p>In an explainer for TC+, Peyton Carr, managing director of Keystone Global Partners, offers a framework for calculating taxation upon an exit and lays out the differences between short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains rates.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a founder, you’ll need to plan for your personal tax situation to optimize the opportunity set that is presented to you.&#8221;</p>

The high-level takeaway? Twitter has value beyond driving traffic for journalists and other users, despite what some critics would have you believe.</li>
<li><strong>Taking action on open source security</strong>:<a href="https://twitter.com/jperezp_bos" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Javier</a> writes about the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4913/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Securing Open Source Software Act,</a> a bipartisan legislation in the U.S. that acknowledges the importance of open source software and states that the federal government should play a supporting role in ensuring its long-term security.</li>

<p>Kenya and Nigeria have both witnessed a proliferation of loan apps in recent years, many of which offer quick unsecured personal credit lines up to $500. The lack of regulations has attracted rogue operators, unfortunately &#8212; roughly<a href="https://twitter.com/ODPC_KE/status/1577645611821703168/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 40 loan apps in Kenya are under investigation</a> by the office of the data protection commissioner over data breach complaints from users. Following the passage of new laws in the countries to clamp down on the industry, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/18/google-clamps-down-on-illegal-loan-apps-in-kenya-nigeria/">Google has begun booting nefarious loan apps</a> available on Android from the Google Play Store, reports<a href="https://twitter.com/annienjanja" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Annie</a>. That&#8217;s welcome news, I’d say.</p>
<p>On the subject of regulation, the FCC this week announced that it&#8217;ll <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/17/fcc-orders-isps-to-show-broadband-nutrition-labels-with-all-fees-and-limits/">require broadband providers to display a “nutrition label” with all fees, catches and caps clearly stated</a> for any plan they offer. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/devin-coldewey/">Devin</a> explains, the labels will show things like price and contract length, whether the price will change after a certain period and &#8220;typical&#8221; download and upload speeds as well as latency. Don&#8217;t expect labels to show up right away &#8212; the FCC&#8217;s rules must first be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget and published in the federal register, at which point broadband providers will have six months to a full year to comply &#8212; but greater transparency in internet plans can only be a good thing, I&#8217;d argue &#8212; even if it comes slowly.</p>
<p>Here’s the rest of this week’s happenings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New chips abound</strong>: Qualcomm debuted its latest flagship <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/17/qualcomm-debuts-latest-flagship-snapdragon-chip-and-a-new-ai-platform/">Snapdragon chip and a new AI platform</a> at the company&#8217;s annual Snapdragon Summit,<a href="https://twitter.com/bheater" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Brian</a> reports. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, as the chip&#8217;s called, boasts improved AI processing and computational photography like recognizing and segmenting different aspects of an image before the photo is taken.</li>
<li><strong>Get crunchy</strong>: Thanks to a partnership between the two companies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/17/now-discord-users-can-link-their-crunchyroll-accounts/">Discord users can now display the movie or TV show they’re watching on Crunchyroll</a> via their personal Discord profile.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/lauren-forristal/"> Lauren</a> notes that Crunchyroll is the latest media company to support &#8220;Rich Presence,&#8221; Discord&#8217;s &#8220;now playing” functionality that automatically displays the video you’re watching, game you’re playing, song you’re listening to and more right in Discord.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy first</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/jagmeets13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jagmeet</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc">Manish</a> cover <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/18/india-digital-data-protection-bill-2022-draft/">India&#8217;s proposed data privacy law</a> that will mandate how companies handle the data of its citizens, including permitting cross-border transfer of information with certain nations. It comes three months after the country&#8217;s regulators abruptly withdrew the previous proposal following scrutiny and concerns from privacy advocates and tech giants.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrogen powered</strong>: Hyundai on Thursday at the Detroit Auto Show revealed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/17/hyundais-hydrogen-fuel-cell-concept-hints-at-the-performance-n-brands-future/">hydrogen fuel cell hybrid concept vehicle called the N Vision 74</a> that the company says demonstrates the performance sub-brand’s vision for electrification. The car&#8217;s hydrogen W fuel cell converts hydrogen to electricity to charge the internal 62 kWh battery &#8212; a clever concept. But, as reported by<a href="https://twitter.com/abigailbassett" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Abigail</a>, Hyundai wouldn’t say whether this kind of powertrain will go into production.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Having trouble keeping up with the conversations in your Chats in your Workspace Spaces? Google feels your pain, and is &#8220;<a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/11/conversation-summaries-in-google-chat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excited to introduce</a> conversation summaries in Google Chat for messages in Spaces.&#8221; Now your conversations in Spaces Chats will be summarized right in your Premium Workspace.</p>
<p>The issue is, of course, that while Chats in Spaces are perfectly good for conversations, in larger Workspaces these Chats conversations can be difficult to keep up with unless you&#8217;re always checking your Spaces for new conversations in Chats.</p>
<p>You know the drill &#8212; you log into your Workspace, click over to your Spaces, pull up the Chats, and your conversations are just too numerous and long-winded to catch up on! You can&#8217;t very well tell your Workspace Spaces conversationalists to leave off chatting in your Chats. Conversation is the very reason Chats exist, that&#8217;s why they call it Spaces! I mean Chats!</p>
<p>Fortunately Google is bringing its expertise in communications apps to remedy this conversational crisis in your Workspace Spaces Chats. Starting soon, the messages in your conversations will be summarized right in your Chats, inside Spaces in Workspaces! Selected Premium Workspaces, anyway.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2445641" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2445641" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2445641" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/herdulikechats.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-2445641" class="wp-caption-text">Google put a summary in your Premium Workspace Spaces Chat conversations. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>You read that correctly. The Conversation Summary of the messages in your Workspace Spaces Chat will appear at the top of the Chats within Spaces, summarizing any unread chatter in the Chats conversation. Click on the summary of the Spaces Chats and you&#8217;ll jump straight to the conversation, even if it&#8217;s already visible and the Conversation summary has only summarized a few lines of the Chats conversation.</p>
<p>If you use Spaces in your Workspace, and tend to have conversations in the Chats of those Spaces, Conversation Summary in Google Chat could be just the thing to keep those chatty Chats summarized. Sadly, this doesn&#8217;t appear to be available for Google Chat, though — which is to say <em>regular</em> Google Chat (that is, the newish one in your Gmail that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/27/google-prompting-remaining-hangouts-users-migrate-chat/">used to be Hangouts</a>, possibly), only Google Chat for Spaces in Workspaces, and (don&#8217;t forgot) select Premium Workspaces at that. Definitely not Meet messaging. So you probably don&#8217;t have access. But you might eventually, if Workspace Spaces Chats are still something that exist in six months. (I&#8217;m checking with Google on this.)</p>
<p>Check out the technical details on how the Google AI team quickly and effectively summarizes conversations in Chats in Spaces in Workspaces <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/11/conversation-summaries-in-google-chat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right here</a>. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ten months after she was found guilty of fraud, the former youngest self-made female billionaire Elizabeth Holmes was sentenced to 11.25 years in prison, plus three years of supervised release. At her trial, she was found guilty on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/elizabeth-holmes-verdict-guilty-theranos-fraud/">four of 11 counts</a> related to defrauding investors, but she was not found guilty of defrauding patients.</p>
<p>The former founder and CEO of Theranos, Holmes could have faced up to 20 years in prison for each of the four counts. By comparison, former pharmaceutical executive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/17/shkreli-arrested/">Martin Shkreli</a> was sentenced to seven years in prison for securities fraud, but was released after a bit more than four years.</p>
<p>At the courthouse in San Jose, both sides of United States vs. Elizabeth Holmes presented their cases regarding whether Judge Edward Davila can consider Holmes&#8217; &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/kari_paul/status/1593674370790019072" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reckless disregard</a>&#8221; of patients in sentencing. Davila rejected that proposal, since at the original trial, Holmes was only found guilty of defrauding investors.</p>
<p>Regardless, it took over four hours before Holmes&#8217; sentence was decided. Alex Schultz, father of whistleblower Tyler Schultz, spoke to the court, recounting how his son slept with a knife under his pillow when he suspected he was being followed by Theranos&#8217; private investigators.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Then, Holmes herself spoke. &#8220;I regret my failings with every cell of my body,&#8221; she <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1593723914332479488">said</a>. That was when Judge Davila delivered his decision.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Holmes is expected to report to prison in <a href="https://twitter.com/eringriffith/status/1593729586000326656" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April</a>. Currently, she is pregnant with her second child.</p>
<h2>Fraud at Theranos</h2>
<p>Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 after dropping out of Stanford. She pitched investors and partners on technology that would revolutionize the healthcare system &#8212; instead of drawing blood intravenously and waiting days for test results, her technology would prick a tiny bit of blood and instantly conduct dozens of tests on it. Soon she was the CEO of a company with a $10 billion valuation, but it turned out that the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-lab-chief-says-he-found-blood-testing-technology-didnt-work-11613602822" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technology didn’t work</a>.</p>
<p>Theranos has been defunct since 2018, but Holmes’ criminal trial only began last fall after delays due to the pandemic and the birth of her first child. According to a letter from Holmes&#8217; husband in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.327949/gov.uscourts.cand.327949.1642.3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public court filing</a>, she is now pregnant with a second child. The filing includes 282 pages of other letters from Holmes&#8217; friends, family and business associates, ranging from childhood photos and drawings to notes from high-profile supporters like Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) and venture capitalist Tim Draper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although there is substantial popular outcry against Theranos and Elizabeth, the attitude in much of the venture world is very different,&#8221; Draper wrote. &#8220;Venture-backed startup companies often announce and deliver products to the market before they are ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>The former CEO&#8217;s sentencing was further delayed because her lawyers tried to request a new trial, arguing that new evidence had come to light after former Theranos lab director Adam Rosendorff visited Holmes at home in an attempt to find closure.</p>
<p>Rosendorff, who worked at Theranos between 2013 and 2014, testified for six days last year during Holmes’ four-month trial. With his highly technical knowledge of the inner workings of Theranos’ labs, Rosendorff’s testimony was key to the trial. In court, he <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-theranos-lab-director-emerges-as-central-prosecution-witness-11633109367?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Holmes knew that Theranos’ technology produced inaccurate blood test results, yet she pushed for it to be used on patients anyway. After repeatedly raising his concerns about the faulty technology, he ultimately quit Theranos.</p>
<p>Holmes’ lawyers alleged that when Rosendorff visited her home this summer, he expressed guilt that he made Theranos seem worse than it was in court. But Judge Edward Davila did not find merit to these allegations. Rosendorff affirmed once again that last year’s testimony was accurate. The former lab director clarified that he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/17/technology/elizabeth-holmes-case-adam-rosendorff.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">felt sorry</a> for Holmes’ child, who will grow up without a mother if she is sent to prison, but not for Holmes herself.</p>
<p>Holmes&#8217; former boyfriend and Theranos COO, Ramesh &#8220;Sunny&#8221; Balwani awaits sentencing. He was convicted on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/07/theranos-sunny-balwani-convicted-fraud-elizabeth-holmes/">12 out of 12 counts</a> in his own trial, where the jury found him guilty of defrauding both patients and investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. government contractor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/booz-allen-hamilton/">Booz Allen Hamilton</a> has disclosed that a former staffer downloaded potentially tens of thousands of employees&#8217; personal information from the company&#8217;s internal network.</p>
<p>The government and defense contractor said that one of its staffers, while still employed by the company, downloaded a report containing the personal information of &#8220;active employees as of March 29, 2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210309101227/https://www.boozallen.com/about/our-people.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">copy of Booz Allen&#8217;s website</a> archived in March 2021 said the company had 27,600 employees, many of whom are contracted to U.S. government, military and intelligence agencies and hold high-level security clearances.</p>
<p>The notice said that the report downloaded by the employee contained, &#8220;your name, Social Security number, compensation, gender, race, ethnicity, date of birth, and U.S. Government security clearance eligibility and status as of March 29, 2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>Booz Allen said the report containing the personal information was &#8220;improperly stored on an internal SharePoint site,&#8221; but did not say what circumstances led to the discovery of the data, only that it &#8220;recently learned&#8221; of the staffer&#8217;s activity.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-559168/?=1668804106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data breach notice</a>, filed with the California attorney general&#8217;s office this week, said the employee obtained the report on April 14, 2022. Booz Allen spokesperson Jessica Klenk said the company learned of the exposure months later on October 5.</p>
<p>The data breach notice said the now-former staffer acted &#8220;in direct contradiction&#8221; of the company&#8217;s policies, but that the company does &#8220;not believe that the individual intended to misuse any of the personal information in the report to cause harm to Booz Allen employees.&#8221; It&#8217;s not clear if the individual has been charged with any criminal offenses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">VinFast showcased four battery-electric SUVs at the LA Auto Show this week, and even hinted at a sports car, as the Vietnam-based automaker pushes ahead with its plan to break into the U.S. market.</p>
<p>The four EVs, which ranged in size from small five-passenger crossovers to large seven-passenger SUVs, is part of the company&#8217;s effort to resonate with U.S. consumers. In an EV market that now has just about every automaker jumping in, it may take more than simply offering SUVs. Although choice is part of the plan, according to Craig Westbrook, the chief service officer of VinFast U.S.</p>
<p>VinFast&#8217;s plan is to flood the space with plenty of options so that Americans get familiar with the new brand, Westbrook told TechCrunch. The executive also hinted that by this time next year, VinFast may show off a sports car for the U.S. market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need a product offensive,&#8221; Westbrook said in an interview at the LA Auto Show. &#8220;We need to come to market strong. We don&#8217;t need to trickle down or ease out models and buying opportunities for the few. So within probably less than a 12-month period, you&#8217;ll have all four models, all SUVs across these four major size and price segments.&#8221;</p>
<p>VinFast expects to bring two SUVs, the VF6 and VF7, to market by early 2023.</p>
<h2>The VinFast SUVs</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2445567" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vinfast-vf6.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2445567" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2445567 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vinfast-vf6.jpg" alt="vinfast vf6" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vinfast-vf6.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vinfast-vf6.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vinfast-vf6.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vinfast-vf6.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vinfast-vf6.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vinfast-vf6.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vinfast-vf6.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vinfast-vf6.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2445567" class="wp-caption-text">VinFast VF6. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>VinFast showed off the VF6, VF7, VF8 and VF9 at the LA Auto Show, and offered ride-alongs in the five-passenger VF8 outside the convention center. Unlike last year&#8217;s auto show, where the company showed off global vehicles the VFe36 and VFe35 with no interiors, the VF6 and VF7 had interiors that customers and media could poke around to get a feel for what the new-to-the-U.S. company might deliver.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the two short laps around the tiny test track in front of the LA Convention Center the VF8 felt like any other EV crossover — the weight of the battery pack, which VinFast estimates will get up to 292 miles of range, is apparent, especially over uneven bumps. The vegan leather interior and large central screen make the interior feel luxurious and surprisingly ample. A large dual-pane roof makes the backseat feel spacious and open, and the ride in the rear is equally engaging.</p>
<p>Westbrook said the VF8 and VF9 vehicles are currently on their way to the U.S. and should be delivered to buyers in early 2023. Globally, VinFast says it has taken 65,000 reservations for the VF8 and VF9, but the company didn&#8217;t have a specific breakdown for North America at the time of our interview.</p>
<p>Most of those orders are coming to California, according to Westbrook, and customers, according to Westbrook&#8217;s observation, are mostly those who are making the first-time EV-leap.</p>
<h2>California focused</h2>
<p>&#8220;Most of the preorders have taken place here [California],&#8221; Westbrook said. &#8220;California is easy. This is where headquarters are and where a port is, and so, we&#8217;re going to serve these customers first. Obviously we want to look at all our customers, but that&#8217;s going to be the first way that we can try to splash into the market as effectively as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>VinFast currently has six retail locations open in California, all located in shopping malls where people can come in and check out the vehicles, much like a Tesla store. Westbrook says that some of the first vehicles coming off the boat from Vietnam will go to stores so that more potential customers can get into the vehicles and test drive them.</p>
<p>Westbrook said that many of the reservation holders have not come to the point in the buying journey where they have to decide between opting for the company&#8217;s somewhat controversial battery leasing program, or buying their vehicle outright. When asked about the reception that reservation holders had to the battery leasing option, Westbrook said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen sort of growing acceptance and interest in the option.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the presentation at the LA Auto Show, Westbrook noted that VinFast recently took an order for 2,500 vehicles from the car subscription company Autonomy, which generally deals only in Teslas.</p>
<h2>New warranty and service options</h2>
<p>VinFast&#8217;s goal is to make the transition to battery-electric as barrier free as possible for new customers, Westbrook said. And to that end, the company announced more details of its bumper-to-bumper warranty, offering an industry-leading 10-year and 125,000-mile of coverage and a 10-year, unlimited-mile battery warranty that the company says is designed to offer EV customers peace of mind as they transition to electric driving.</p>
<p>The company also announced a mobile service that will come to customers or offer rideshare options if customers get stranded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that when it comes to quality, people have expectations, and we have to meet them,&#8221; Westbrook said. &#8220;We do understand that when you purchase car over here and our service point is over there, you may not want to come to us. So we can help you, right? And that&#8217;s part of our model. It&#8217;s not being forced into something. We realize that&#8217;s what you want as a customer.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The COVID-19 pandemic was many things. Global contagion. Health catastrophe. Herald of new geopolitical tensions and a long-running commentary on how far we’re willing to go to protect — or not — our fellow humans. It was also a business earthquake that shook up most industries around the world.</p>
<p>But as quickly as COVID came on the scene, breaking supply lines and business models, it also faded. In the wake of most of the world learning to live with — or merely deciding to endure — the health impacts of the pandemic, many industries snapped back to their prior form. Airlines went from trash to first class; in contrast, tech companies flipped from darlings to disparaged.</p>

<hr />
<p>Some tech concerns picked up tailwinds during COVID, in that a newly reformed business climate helped them grow for a time. You can cast a wide net here: Robinhood exploding in part thanks to consumers stuck at home with more cash than usual, Instacart seeing explosive demand for its grocery delivery service. Some tech companies went the other way, as was the case with Airbnb&#8217;s business cratering during the early COVID months as <em>going places</em> went from aspirational to insane overnight.</p>

Robinhood lost some of its shine as its user base, per the usually chatted narrative, went back outside. Instacart saw its growth slow but managed to hold onto its pandemic-era gains.</p>
<p>Airbnb, an early example of the layoffs that COVID could induce at erstwhile healthy companies, recovered, and has retained much of its value since going public, a rare feat for its IPO cohort.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div><p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/18/quantifying-the-global-e-commerce-slowdown/">Quantifying the global e-commerce slowdown</a> by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.com/author/anna-heim/">Anna Heim</a> originally published on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the downturn began, many VCs urged founders to slash their marketing spending. On its face, that&#8217;s an effective way to extend runway while cutting costs.</p>
<p>Several months later, we’ve since learned that cutting marketing budgets doesn&#8217;t make early-stage startups healthier, but it is a great way for VCs to reduce burn rates across their entire portfolio.</p>
<p>As Rebecca Szkutak reported this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/17/saas-startups-that-ignored-vc-advice-to-cut-sales-and-marketing-were-better-off-this-year">SaaS startups that ignored this advice outperformed the ones that followed it</a>.</p>

	</p>
<p>In business, if someone&#8217;s offering you advice, it&#8217;s probably for their own benefit. Which is why I take investors at their word when they say most founders cannot properly assess their total addressable market (TAM).</p>
<p>Most founders submit a slide with three concentric circles: TAM on the outside, SAM (serviceable addressable market) in the middle and SOM (serviceable obtainable market) in the center.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Full TechCrunch+ articles are only available to members.<br />
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">Use discount code <strong>TCPLUSROUNDUP</strong></a> to save 20% off a one- or two-year subscription.</i></p>
<hr />
<p>&#8220;When this slide appears, most investors chuckle (or weep),&#8221; writes Bill Reichert, partner and chief evangelist at Pegasus Tech Ventures.</p>
<p>Few investors will wire funds based on how many billions you think you&#8217;ll make in year eight. Instead, founders must demonstrate that they have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/17/tam-takedown-investors-are-looking-for-market-opportunity-not-just-size/">a directional plan and a keen understanding of prospective users</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many customers will you acquire this year? Next year? The year after?&#8221; asks Reichert. And just as importantly, &#8220;How many can you convert? How will you reach them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t spend too much time calculating future revenue or reading Gartner studies for factoids that sound authoritative. Instead, build a bottom-up model that focuses on the size of the opportunity, not the market.</p>
<p>&#8220;Show investors how you are going to build an ever-expanding cadre of delighted customers,&#8221; Reichert advises. &#8220;Don’t suggest that your focus is on acquiring market share in a large established market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Have a great weekend,</p>

<p>Investors might enjoy listening to a founder’s well-rehearsed story, but sharing the right customer data “can definitively power up a pitch deck,” says David Smith, VP of data and analytics at TheVentureCity.</p>
<p>“Investors need to see that you’re not being blindsided by easy wins that can go up in smoke within weeks, but are using hard data to build a sustainable company that will endure, and thrive, with time.”</p>

<p>Many VCs advised founders to dial back their sales and marketing outlays to preserve runway this year. And, as it turns out, many VCs have been giving the wrong advice.</p>
<p>According to data from Capchase, a fintech that offers startups non-dilutive capital, &#8220;companies that didn’t cut spending on sales and marketing were in a better financial and growth position now than those that did when the market started to dip in 2022,&#8221; reports Rebecca Szkutak.</p>
<p>Of the 500 companies surveyed, bootstrapped firms showed the strongest growth, said Miguel Fernandez, Capchase&#8217;s co-founder and CEO.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we have seen in this case, and what is most interesting, is that the best companies have actually cut every other cost except sales and marketing.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>My co-founder and I were both laid off from Big Tech last week and it’s the kick we needed to go all-in on our startup.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We’re first-time founders, but they need immigration sponsorship to maintain status with our startup.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do we look at an O-1A in the 60-day grace period? Thanks!</strong></p>

<p>Getting a startup off the ground is hard work, so asking founders to prepare for an acquisition may sound just as silly as telling them to practice their Academy Award speech in the bathroom mirror.</p>
<p>Still: If you&#8217;re ready to launch a startup, you must also be prepared to sell one.</p>
<p>In an explainer for TC+, Peyton Carr, managing director of Keystone Global Partners, offers a framework for calculating taxation upon an exit and lays out the differences between short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains rates.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Cybersecurity continues to be a hot topic. More and more organizations are getting hit by ransomware attacks, critical open software vulnerabilities are making news, and we&#8217;re seeing industries and governments coming together to discuss initiatives to improve software security.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has been working with the tech industry and open source organizations such as the Linux Foundation and the Open Source Security Foundation to come up with a number of initiatives in the past couple of years.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White House Executive Order on Improving the Nation&#8217;s Cybersecurity</a> without a doubt kick-started subsequent initiatives and defined requirements for government agencies to take action on software security and, in particular, open source security. An important <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/13/readout-of-white-house-meeting-on-software-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White House meeting with tech industry leaders</a> produced active working groups, and only a few weeks later, they issued the <a href="https://8112310.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/8112310/OpenSSF/OSS%20Mobilization%20Plan.pdf?hsCtaTracking=3b79d59d-e8d3-4c69-a67b-6b87b325313c%7C7a1a8b01-65ae-4bac-b97c-071dac09a2d8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Source Software Security Mobilization Plan</a>. This plan included 10 streams of work and budget designed to address high-priority security areas in open source software, from training and digital signatures, to code reviews for top open source projects and the issuance of a software bill of materials (SBOM).</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The Act directly addresses the top three areas of focus to improve open source security: vulnerability detection and disclosure, SBOMs and OSPOs.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>One recent government initiative regarding open source security is the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4913/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Securing Open Source Software Act,</a> a bipartisan legislation by U.S. Senators Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan, and Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio. Senators Peters and Portman are chairman and ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, respectively. They were at the <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/apache-senate-log4j-years/618567/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Log4j Senate hearings</a>, and subsequently introduced this legislation to improve open source security and best practices in the government by establishing the duties of the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).</p>
<p>This is a turning point in U.S. legislation, because, for the first time, it is specific to open source software security. The legislation acknowledges the importance of open source software and recognizes that “a secure, healthy, vibrant, and resilient open source software ecosystem is crucial for ensuring the national security and economic vitality of the United States.” Finally, it states that the Federal Government should play a supporting role in ensuring the long-term security of open source software. <div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div><p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/18/the-us-securing-open-source-software-act-of-2022-is-a-step-in-the-right-direction/">The US Securing Open Source Software Act of 2022 is a step in the right direction</a> by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.com/author/ram-iyer/">Ram Iyer</a> originally published on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a></p>
